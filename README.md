# Heroes Matchmaker
#### Just playing around with socket.io and express 3

This should work

```
git clone git@github.com:pixelmixr\matchmaker.git
npm install
```
Then just head over to `localhost:3000`  
Open two browser tabs to see it propagate the chat messages.  

I'll add an explanation of the structure later.  It's hella late right now :)
